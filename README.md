## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Router
- TypeScript

### What I learned

### React Router

This is the first project that I am using React Router.

### TypeScript

This is also the first project that I have used TypeScript in.

### CSS Features:

#### Using rgb(from)

The syntax `rgb(from {color} r g b / alpha)` can be used to alter a preset color, including it's alpha value. I used this for the background colour of the navbar, as it has some transparency so I needed to alter the alpha value:

```css
background-color: rgb(from v.$color-white r g b / 0.05);
```
